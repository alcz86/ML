# From Business Intelligence to Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Here is my repository created to gather information about ML&AI topics.
Feel free to look at my examples. A lot of them are still being improved from time to time. 
Most of them were developed with AWS, GCP or Colab and here is only kind of a backup for them.
